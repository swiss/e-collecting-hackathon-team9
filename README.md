# 9) Kryptographie, verteiltes System, E-ID Vertrauensinfrastruktur

*Over the course of two days, you will develop your solution for collecting electronic signatures for popular initiatives and referendums from A to Z, addressing the 10 topics outlined in the [guidelines](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/aktuelles.html). Your prototype can be conceptual, clickable, and/or technical. Either way, you should clearly present the interactions and data flows between actors, software, and infrastructure components over time, as well as the user experience of these actors.*

## Approach

*A brief description of your approach, a link/reference to the detailed description of your approach and what you have already created (if applicable). Please also mention which skills you need for your team.*

## Documentation and Diagrams

*Together, you will contribute to comparing different ways of how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland from A to Z. As part of the [participatory process](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/partizipativer_prozess.html), your solutions will be discussed in subsequent workshops and will possibly be taken into account for the official decision on the design of the federal e-collecting trials. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated:*

1. **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram(s) showing interactions and data flows between actors, software and infrastructure components of your solution over time.**
2. **Wireframes or mockups with user flow showing the user experience of different actors** (using e.g. Figma)
3. Explain how you addressed the topics presented in the [guidelines](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/aktuelles.html), filling in the template below.
4. List the key strengths and weaknesses of your solution.
5. Explanation of features used (if applicable)
6. A requirements file with all packages and versions used (if applicable)
7. Environment code to be run (if applicable)

*For your reference, you will find below an example of two diagrams showing interactions and data flows between actors, software and infrastructure components of ordering a pizza via a third-party delivery website over time. Please replace them with diagrams for your solution.*

### Flowchart: High-level Process (Example)

*An overall process flow showing the main steps and system/actor interactions for ordering a pizza online via a delivery website, including software, infrastructure, and handoff to the restaurant and delivery driver.*

```mermaid

    Customer([Customer])
    DeliverySite("Delivery Website (Web/App)")
    Backend("Website Backend Server")
    OrderDB[(Order Database)]
    Restaurant("Restaurant Order System")
    Driver("Delivery Driver")

   Backend-->|"4 Send Order to Restaurant"|Restaurant
   Restaurant-->|"5 Ack/Confirmation"|Backend

   Restaurant-->|"8 Assign/Notify Delivery"|Driver
   Driver-->|"9 Pickup & Deliver"|Customer
   Driver-->|"10 Update Status"|DeliverySite
   DeliverySite-->|"11 Show Status"|Customer

```

### Sequence Diagram: Detailed Interactions & Data Flows (Example)

*A step-by-step illustration showing how data and requests are exchanged between actors (customer, delivery site, restaurant, infrastructure), and key software components in the order process.*

```mermaid

    actor Customer
    participant WebApp as "Delivery Website (UI)"
    participant Backend as "Backend Server"
    participant DB as "Order Database"
    participant Restaurant as "Restaurant System"
    actor Driver as "Delivery Driver"

    Customer->>WebApp: Browse menu, select pizza (menu data)
    Customer->>WebApp: Submit order (pizza, address, payment info)
    WebApp->>Backend: Create order {pizza, address, payment}
    Backend->>DB: Save order {orderId, customer, items, payment}
    Backend->>Restaurant: API: send order {orderId, items, address}
    Restaurant-->>Backend: Ack/Confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Backend-->>WebApp: Show confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    WebApp-->>Customer: Order confirmation {orderId, ETA}
    Restaurant->>Driver: Notify driver {pickup, delivery}
    Driver-->>Restaurant: Pickup ack
    Driver->>Customer: Deliver pizza
    Driver->>Backend: Update status {orderId, delivered}
    Backend->>WebApp: Status update {delivered}
    WebApp->>Customer: Show status {delivered}

```
